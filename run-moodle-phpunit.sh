# Simple script to run CWD site phpunit tests.
#
# It will be called by who-broke-it.sh.
#
# Info:
#   - Moodle's dirroot contains the codebase and a config.php with:
#     * $CFG->phpunit_dataroot
#     * $CFG->phpunit_prefix
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 => When called through git bisect (== 1) whether we should return an
#   exit code after finishing.
#
# Failed test:
#   testcase filepath (e.g. core_demo_testcase lib/tests/demo_test.php)
